Have you had a good night Sir? 
"Tomorrow, I will go to school"
How is your news?
My younger is a girl
I do not defame anyone
I see with an eye
My father is a gentleman
My father has boots
I have panties
The buffalo likes to run
The termite is not the vegetable
I wash the glasses
Each with his teacher
I must go to the water
We have a dog and a cat
I am going to wash my hands
Bəʼmbemə is harder than potato
Family peace gives joy to the heart
My grandfather is living in Bazou
I have a grandfather
My mother has malaria
I am back from school
The cat hates the mouse
It’s my hands working
I am a man
I am drinking water
The kitchen is in the yard
There are lot of goods in the stands
We have a family
In the morning we will align ourselves
"Yes, I agree"
My clothe is torn
I passed my exam
My pen is lost
My family love me
How?
Good bye Sir
"Yes, gentleman"
I have a stomach and a back
My mother has a scarf
Do not go to the farm without a hoe
We go out in the morning
I am going to the water steam
The rooms have wooden beds
Today
Good night to you
Did you have a good day mummy?
My younger brother fell
Choose Time
My elder brother is strong
I understood well
We coming home from school
Good morning madam
"Yes, my daughter"
The head has two eyes
The mask dance well the lali
The body has two arms
Enjoy your meal
I listen with ears
Students are often numerous
I have many parts of the human body
My grandfather is tired
Next Month
My father is a boy
"Machetes, knives are goods"
