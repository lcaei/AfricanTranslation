Everyone has his counter
Did you have a good day daddy?
My wife is not cured yet
My wife is still sick
How are the news?
"Daddy, did you sleep well?"
There is a lot of fly in the butcher’s shop
Our school is big with a lot of classrooms
I am a student
The toilet is behind the kitchen
"Yes, my son"
It’s my hands that sweep
I am coming back from the market
I greeted my elder
Previous Month
Peanut is good for white sauce
Zizi scold tutu
The obedient child is good
Everyone’s village is bone-free meat
We are from harvesting
Seconds
I wash the socks
The TV set is on the chair
Without money do not go to the market
D not whistle at night
I wish to you a good stay
