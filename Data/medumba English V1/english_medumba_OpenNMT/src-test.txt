I am a person
The head has two eyes
It’s my hands washing
Good bye madam
My paternal sister loves me
Yes my son
Cokod counts the furrows
Too much illnesses in the world
I have a diploma
Yam seller has a basket
Our house has white color
Your news is good?
Good appetite to you
I am a gentleman
Open the window
There are lot of goods in the stands
It is the potato which left to be eaten raw
We are often numerous on route
Is not going
The termite is not the vegetable
I am a pupil 
We coming home from school
Today is the day of the market
The machetes help my father
I am going to wash my hands
The living room has chairs and wooden cabinet
I had a child
How?
I greeted my daddy
Previous Month
My father has a trouser
Harvest the plantain with the machete
My elder is my uncle
Rice has taken the place of beans
I have colic
Zizi scold tutu
Good morning Sir
My pen is lost
I often go to school
The voice of ndʉ̂ ʼ CEPOM goes far
The bird looks like the hen
My mother has a scarf
"Yes, my daughter"
Good morning daddy
My knit is clean
We are going to school
I am constipated 
Fufu is appetizing
My mother has malaria
Students are in a row
The head has two ears
How is your news?
I write with my hands
Did you have a good day mummy?
"Machetes, knives are goods"
My tooth is removed
The bricklayer is strong
The living room has a TV set and a margin guard
We go out in the morning
My stomach is in front
Set Date
The body has three parts
The kitchen is in the yard
My figure looks like my father’s
Have you had a good night Sir?
