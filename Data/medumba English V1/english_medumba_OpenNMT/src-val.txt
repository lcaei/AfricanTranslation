The family has a meeting
We have a family
My father is a boy
Even my mother has dresses
Good morning mummy 
I know how to dance ndαènzi
Good night to you
Even the mud extinguishes the fire
Close the window
My younger brother fell
Good bye Sir
The chick seller buys the raven
I have tee-shirt
Set Time
It’s my hands working
I wear clothes with my arms
"Yes, I agree"
Bəʼmbemə is harder than potato
I take food with my hands
I sat down and ate
I wash the spoons
Bəʼntuju is good with tagkena
Set Duration
Goat and sheep eat grass
The body has two arms
Teachers are the most numerous at school
